An updated version of the original React App but replacing Redux with React Hooks for state management

## Changes
 1. Use of **SQLite** as database instead of *Postgres* for more portability, a more straightforward configuration and a ready-to-use API.
 2. Use of **Vite** instead of *Create React App* for scaffolding application.
