An updated version of the original React App but replacing Redux with React Hooks for state management

## Changes

1. The _Postgres_ database has been replaced with **SQLite** for increased portability, a simpler configuration, and a ready-to-use API.
2. _Create React App_ has been replaced with **Vite** for application scaffolding.
